## 1.
For the equation:

$$ 2xy^2+2xy+x^2y $$

what u=is the slope of the tangent line at $(x,y)=(2,1)$ ? 

#### Solution
Using the product rule, we have:

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dx} 2xy^2+2xy+x^2y &= 4xyy'+ 2y^2+ 2xy'+ 2y + x^2y' + 2xy= 0 \\ 
(4xy+2x+x^2)y' &= -2y^2-2y-2xy  \\
y' &=\frac{-2y^2-2y-2xy}{4xy+2x+x^2} \\
\end{aligned}$$

for $ (x,y)=(2,1) $, we have:

$$ y' =\frac{-2-2-4}{8+4+4} = -\frac{1}{2} $$
